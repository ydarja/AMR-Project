# Overview
This project investigates the universality of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) by translating reduced AMR structures of "The Little Prince" across English, Chinese, and Persian.
The aim is to evaluate how AMR captures cross-linguistic semantics and to analyze the impact of structural divergences on translation accuracy.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into 3 main directories:  

`Code/:` Contains scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation  
`Data/:` Includes raw and processed AMR data files  
`models/` Includes best saved models  

# How to Use
**Prepare Data:** Place your raw AMR data in the Data/ directory and use the provided scripts to preprocess it  
**Train Model:** Execute the training scripts to build and train your models  
**Evaluate:** Use the evaluation scripts to assess model performance and analyze the results
